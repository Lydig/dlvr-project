<p>Potential projects usually fall into these two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Pick a real-world problem and apply ConvNets to solve it.</li>
<li><strong>Models:</strong> Build a new model/algorithm with ConvNets, or a new variant of models, and apply it to solve vision tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a better feeling for what we expect from the projects, we encourage you to take a look at the project reports from one of the previous years (<a href="report%20examples.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report examples.zip</a>). You might also preview the slides from one of the coming lectures (<a href="HowToWriteAGoodReport.pdf?isCourseFile=true" target="_self">HowToWriteAGoodReport.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>To inspire ideas, we recommend visiting places like <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/area/computer-vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papers with Code</a>, <a href="https://ai.papers.bar/papers/weekly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily AI Papers</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/yannickilcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yannic Kilcher's YouTube channel</a>. You might also&nbsp;preview the slides from one of the the coming lectures (<a href="ProjectIdeas.pdf?isCourseFile=true" target="_self">ProjectIdeas.pdf</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your project should involve pixels of visual data in some form.</li>
<li>You must train a neural network model, evaluate it and perform experiments to improve its performance.</li>
<li>When designing your project, keep the deep learning workflow in mind:
<ul>
<li>Acquire and prepare a dataset for deep learning</li>
<li>Set up an appropriate deep learning model (i.e., a neural network) to solve the task at hand</li>
<li>Train and test your model with the correct evaluation metrics</li>
<li>Perform motivated experiments to improve your model's performance</li>
<li>Explain your results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You should demonstrate that you are familiar with all of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful not to end up spending all your time building a complete application. Your course project should focus on the deep learning part, not the system around it.</li>
<li>Discuss your project ideas with the TAs (available on Slack and on Thursdays during TØ). They can give you feedback and advice you on scoping the project such that it is not too under/over-ambitious.</li>
<li>
<div>Sharing code and copying code from places like GitHub is allowed, but if you use other people's code, you must add a significant amount of your own work/code on top of it. Again, ask the TAs for advice.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Be aware that a lot of code found on GitHub is deprecated. If you cannot get the code up and running in a few hours, its often not worth pursuing.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important dates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Group formation completed mid September</li>
<li>Hand in one-page project proposal by end of September</li>
<li>Final report submission no later than <strong>Friday 5th December</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group formation</strong></p>
<p>You must work in groups of 2-3 people.</p>
<p>We have set up a Slack forum where you can meet up and form groups (see course frontpage under "Slack discussion forum").</p>
<p><strong>Report</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use this <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/style-and-template-for-preprints-arxiv-bio-arxiv/fxsnsrzpnvwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv template</a> for your report.</li>
<li>Report should be structured like a research paper:
<ul>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Introduction (Includes motivation and objectives of your project. Be realistic and be specific!)</li>
<li>Related work (Summarize at least 2-3 key references and discuss how they relate to your project)</li>
<li>Methods (What did you do and how? Describe network architecture, data set, experiments, etc.)</li>
<li>Results (Objectively summarize your results and compare to your baseline model and/or the papers covered in your related work section)</li>
<li>Discussion (How well did you do? What worked? What didn’t work?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final report between 6-8 pages <span style="text-decoration: underline;">including pictures/figures</span>. Stay within the limits, thanks!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You must hand in your project source code to document that you did the work yourselves. A link to Google Colab or GitHub is fine, but you can also upload the code as a file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If possible, please provide code or instructions to download your dataset.</li>
<li>IMPOTANT: Please do not upload your data to Brightspace!</li>
</ul></body></html>
