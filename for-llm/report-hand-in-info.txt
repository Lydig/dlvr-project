Report

    You must submit a written report of your project.
    Please use the official arXiv template for your report.
    Your report should be structured like a research paper:
        Abstract
        Introduction (Includes motivation and objectives of your project. Be realistic and be specific!)
        Related work (Summarize at least 2-3 key references and discuss how they relate to your project)
        Methods (What did you do and how? Describe network architecture, data set, experiments, etc.)
        Results (Objectively summarize your results and compare to your baseline model and/or the papers covered in your related work section)
        Discussion (How well did you do? What worked? What didn’t work?)
    The final report must be 6-8 pages, including figures and references. Stay within the limits, and avoid placing excessive material in an appendix, as it will not be read.
    Upload the report to Brightspace no later than December 5.

You must also submit the following (see details below):

    A contribution statement (December 5)
    A 5-minute video presentation (December 12)
    Your source code (December 5)

Contribution Statement

    All groups must submit a separate document describing the contribution of each group member.
    Provide 1–3 sentences per person describing what they contributed (e.g., model implementation, experiments, data preparation, literature review, reporting, etc.).
    The document should reflect the actual distribution of work - not an idealized or equal distribution.
    Submit the document to Brightspace no later than December 5.
    Note: This document is used for transparency and fairness. It does not affect your grade directly unless there are issues of unequal participation.

Video recording

    You must submit a 5-minute video where you present your project.
    Use slides if you wish, but it is perfectly acceptable to simply scroll through your report while explaining your work.
    You may upload the video directly to Brightspace or provide a link (e.g., YouTube).
    The video is the only file that may be submitted after December 5 (deadline: December 12).
    If you submit the video recording after December 5, make a re-submission on Brightspace and ignore any warning messages.

Code

    You must submit your project’s source code to document that you carried out the work yourselves.
    A GitHub link or Google Colab notebook is fine, but you may also upload a ZIP file.
    If possible, include code to download your dataset. Otherwise, provide a link to the original data source.
    Do not upload datasets to Brightspace.
    You must submit/share your code no later than December 5.
